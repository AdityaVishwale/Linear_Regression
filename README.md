# Linear_Regression

# Simple Linear Regression Model on a Housing dataset 

- Linear regression is a widely used regression technique.​
- It’s employed for predicting a continuous target variable.​
- Assumption: Assumes a linear relationship between input features and the target.​

1. Load and explore the data -->
Import necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib),
 Load the dataset,
 Display basic information (head, info, describe).
2. Handle missing values -->
 Identify missing values,
 Decide on strategy (remove, impute, or leave as is),
 Implement chosen strategy.
3. Handle categorical variables -->
 Identify categorical columns,
 Perform encoding (one-hot encoding or label encoding).
4. Feature scaling -->
 Normalize or standardize numerical features.
5. Handle outliers -->
 Detect outliers using visualizations or statistical methods,
 Decide on treatment (remove, transform, or leave as is).
6. Feature engineering -->
 Create new features if applicable,
 Transform existing features if needed.
7. Split the data -->
 Divide into training and testing sets.
8. Save preprocessed data -->
 Save the cleaned and preprocessed dataset for further analysis.
